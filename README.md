Baby, I'm a sociopath,

Sweet serial killer.

On the warpath,

'Cause I love you just a little too much.

I love you just a little too much (much, much, much).



You can see me drinking cherry cola,

Sweet serial killer.

I left a love note,

Said you know I love the thrill of the rush.

You know I love the thrill of the rush (rush, rush, rush).
